# Grafico: The Non-Profit Annual Report Generator

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
Grafico is a cloud-based application that creates an annual report document using data provided by the user. 

### 1.2 Intended Audience
The intended audience is Nonprofit administrators, not technical users who need to create annual reports.

### 1.3 Intended Use
Manual report creation is tedious and time-consuming. Grafico automates the process of aggregating data, generating charts/graphs, and formatting the report document. This saves users time and effort.

Manual report creation lacks consistency. When reports are created manually, there may be inconsistencies in formatting, data accuracy, branding, etc. Grafico provides consistent, standardized reports each time.
