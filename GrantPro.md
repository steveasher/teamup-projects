This tool aims to reduce the time and effort required in writing proposals while increasing the chances of success in securing grants.

### 1.2 Intended Audience
The primary users of GrantPro are nonprofit organizations, specifically their grant writing teams.

### 1.3 Intended Use
GrantPro is intended to be used as a collaborative platform for grant writing. It provides assistance in drafting, editing, and refining grant proposals. The tool offers templates, writing suggestions, and compliance checks to ensure that proposals meet the requirements of different grantors. It is not a replacement for human oversight but a supportive tool to enhance the quality and efficiency of proposal writing.
